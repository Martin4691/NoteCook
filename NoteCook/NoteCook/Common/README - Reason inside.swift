 HI EVERYONE!!!

I'm glad to see you here.
This is my first absolutly independent app and I'm so excited to show it in my social media profiles.
 
First let me to say you a couple of things about NoteCook.
- NoteCook is an app to manage a stock. If you are a chef or anithing similar, you will see that NoteCook is a useful tool for you. You can see the product and quantity of them there is. V.1: you can see the name or number of your contac provide you the product, and V.2: You will have a link to the contact on your phonebook.

- NoteCook is an app growing up every week, I try to upload the changes and show them in my social media profiles (LinkedIn and GitHub).

- The button to "load profile (loadProfile)" is mandatory step to load the profile selected on the picker view.







I hope you enjoy the app.
All feedback is welcome.

Thank you, Martín Sánchez.
